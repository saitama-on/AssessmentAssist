A . Database Structure Choice
->I chose MongoDB with Mongoose because:

a.Flexibility: Questions have polymorphic structure (different fields per type)
b.Scalability: Easy to add new question types without schema migrations
c.Performance: Embedded documents (options, items, zones) avoid costly joins
d.JSON Native: Frontend already uses JSON structure - direct mapping

Refer the demoSchema.js for detailed schema.



B. Handling Human in the Loop for LLM generated content

-> Authors can edit any content generated by LLM before finalizing it.
-> Any edits made by the author can be fed back to the LLM to generate better content in
the future.


C. Handling Version Control

const questionSchema = new Schema({
  ...baseQuestionSchema,

  version: {
    type: Number,
    default: 1
  },
  previousVersion: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Question'
  },
  changeLog: [{
    version: Number,
    changedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
    changedBy: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
    changes: String // Simple description of changes
  }]
}, {
  timestamps: true
});


Explanation:

1. version: Tracks version number
2. previousVersion: Reference to previous version
3. changeLog: Array of changes with version, timestamp, user, and description
